\section{Introduction}
This report discusses the implementation of a CTL model checker for Petri Nets using BDDs. The implementation uses the multi-core decision diagram library Sylvan \parencite{sylvan}. A set of Petri Net models is used to validate the correctness of the implementation. These models that are used are from the Model Checking Contest \parencite{mcc:2017}. For a small sample of models the implementation gives results for satcount and CTL model checking that are consistent with the results from reference implementations.

\subsection{Implemented Features}

The features that are implemented are a follows:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Reachability
\item SatCount
\item CTL Model Checking
\end{enumerate}
\section{Representing a petri net as BDD}
Input to the model checker are ANDL files. An ANDL file specifies the places and transitions in a petri net. The model checker parses ANDL files and maintains a representation that can be used to later create description diagrams. The parser maintains a hashmap of transitions and places in an \texttt{andl\_context\_t} type, defined in \texttt{andl.h}. The places hashmaps uses \texttt{places\_struct\_t} which maps the place name to a BDD variable and an initial marking. The transitions hashmap maps transition names to \texttt{transitions\_struct\_t}, which contains arrays of incoming arc and outgoing arcs. An arc is then an integer which is the BDD variable of the place the arc relates to.
